## Description
This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the waning hope and dwindling enthusiasm of an entire generation, summed up in three words sung most famously by Alanis Morrissette: 

> ### Isn't it ironic?
> Morrissette, Alanis. “Ironic.” *Jagged Little Pill*, 1995

When activated, you will randomly see a lyric from <cite>Ironic</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. Forked from the classic "[Hello Dolly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/)" plugin by [Matt Mullenweg](https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/).
